| Letter | Principle       | Description                                                                 |
|--------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| F      | **Fast**         | Tests should execute quickly and not block the development flow             |
| I      | **Isolated**     | Tests must not rely on shared state or test execution order                 |
| R      | **Repeatable**   | Tests should always produce the same result regardless of environment       |
| S      | **Self-validating** | Tests must use assertions – no manual inspection                         |
| T      | **Timely**       | Tests should be written early (ideally TDD or immediately after code)       |
